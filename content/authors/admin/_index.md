I am a researcher at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina-strutturale/home) (Near Eastern Archaeology). My research interests include Settlement Pattern Analysis, Remote Sensing, GIS, and mapping. 

During my Ph.D. I analysed Iron Age settlement patterns along the Euphrates river in ancient Mesopotamia. I used a landscape archaeology approach, also integrating geomorphology, remote sensing, quantitative and spatial analyses.
